### Ada Lovelace
<img src="images/figures/ada_lovelace.jpg" align="left" height="100px">
Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.

### Grace Hopper

### Margaret Hamilton

In a field dominated by men, Hamilton was a trailblazer in the field of software engineering — incidentally, a term she coined. She not only played a significant role in making space travel possible, she also forged a decades-long career as a programmer and even founded her own company, Hamilton Technologies, Inc.

## LGBT
Got to be more careful here - can't really "out" someone as being female or PoC, but face that problem with LGBT. Recommendation: Only include if they are a publicly-out figure.
