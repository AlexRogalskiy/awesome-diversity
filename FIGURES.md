# Minority Figures in Technology History

Some of these are figures in scientific or maths history too. 

## Women

### Ada Lovelace
<img src="images/figures/ada_lovelace.jpg" align="left" height="100px">
Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.

### Grace Hopper
<img src="images/figures/grace_hopper.jpg" align="left" height="100px">
Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.

### Margaret Hamilton
<img src="images/figures/margaret_hamilton.jpg" align="left" height="100px">
In a field dominated by men, Hamilton was a trailblazer in the field of software engineering — incidentally, a term she coined. She not only played a significant role in making space travel possible, she also forged a decades-long career as a programmer and even founded her own company, Hamilton Technologies, Inc.

### Hedy Lamarr
<img src="images/figures/hedy_lamarr.jpg" align="left" height="100px">
Famous Hollywood actress and inventor. Not only was she known as one of the most beautiful women of her day, but she also invented a technology that enables the mass use of mobile phones and other wireless communications.

### Elizabeth Feinler

Elizabeth Feinler pioneered and managed first the ARPANET, and then the Defense Data Network (DDN), network information centers (NIC) under contract to the Department of Defense (DoD). Both of these early networks were the forerunners of today’s Internet.

### Yvonne Marie Andrés

Dr. Yvonne Marie Andrés was one of the earliest people to utilize the Internet to develop and advance global e-learning opportunities for educators and students.

### Tracy LaQuey Parker
<img src="images/figures/tracylaqueyparker.png" align="left" height="100px">
Former Chief Technology Office of Cisco Systems, where she founded its Worldwide Education focus and Advanced Internet Initiatives, and continued to promote the Internet in academic environments and K-12 schools. She also led Cisco's participation in Internet Society activities internationally. Parker carries the distinction of being the first individual to successfully sue a spammer, who forged her domain name, in a lawsuit that helped to advance legal understanding of the digital frontier.

## LGBTQ
Got to be more careful here - can't really "out" someone as being female or PoC, but face that problem with LGBTQ. Recommendation: Only include if they are a publicly-out figure.

### Alan Turing
<img src="images/figures/alan_turing.png" align="left" height="100px">
English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts and accepted chemical castration treatment as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.

### Frank Greene
He developed high-speed semiconductor computer-memory systems at Fairchild Semiconductor R&D Labs in the 1960s. He started two technology companies and later founded NewVista Capital, a venture firm with a special focus on minority- and female-headed firms.

## Submission Guidelines

* Ensure the figure is notable. [Use the Wikipedia guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability). We don't want to list your neighbor Nancy who happens to fix PCs in her spare time! ;)
* For LGBTQ figures, please ensure they are historical or publically "out"
* For figures who fit into several categories - I have no idea yet
* Please order figures alphabetically by surname
